## Description

De:Coded is a storytelling web application that features an interactive story presented with visually appealing animations, custom fonts, and dynamic user interfaces. The application showcases the implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging user experience.

## Features Included

- **Custom Font: Seuss**
  The application utilizes a custom font called "Seuss," which is loaded using the @font-face CSS rule. This distinctive font enhances the visual style of the story presentation, giving it a unique and playful feel.

- **Dynamic Background Waves**
  The header section of the application features dynamic background waves created using SVG graphics and CSS animations. These waves contribute to the overall visual aesthetic and add a sense of motion to the page.

- **Interactive Mad Libs**
  The application includes an interactive "Mad Libs" section that allows users to input their own words to complete a story template. The user inputs are presented in a styled container, creating an engaging and playful storytelling experience.

- **Story Preview**
  The "Story Preview" section showcases the completed story with the user's inputted words. This section is designed with a background image and styling that complements the storytelling theme.

- **Interactive Cat Animation**
  A playful and interactive cat animation is integrated into the application. Users can interact with the cat by pressing the "Enter" key or hovering the mouse over the cat. The cat's position and eyes animate in response to these interactions, adding an element of fun and engagement to the experience.

- **Volume Control**
  A volume control slider is provided, allowing users to adjust the volume of an audio feature, although the implementation details for the audio are not present in the provided code.

- **Contributors' Information**
  The application acknowledges the contributors who worked on the project by displaying their names with a preview animation. This adds a personal touch and highlights the collaborative effort behind the project.

- **Responsive Design**
  Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided code, it's important to note that responsive design principles should be applied to ensure the application is usable across various screen sizes and devices.

- **Background Image and Styling**
  The application employs background images and styling to enhance the visual appeal of the content. The use of background images helps create a cohesive and engaging visual narrative.

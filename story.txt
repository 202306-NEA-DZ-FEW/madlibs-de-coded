In a vibrant[a] town, mischief would bloom,
A trickster[n] brought chaos, a wild typhoon.
With a twinkle in his eye, oh, how he'd gleam[v],
Stirring up colors like in a dream.

A golden[a] ticket called his name one day,
Guiding him where colors held sway.
A keeper of secrets, rules[v] were clear,
Ignore them, a price[n] would appear[v].

Buttons he pressed, candies[n] took flight,
Whirlwind of colors, such a sight.
A figure appeared, sighed[v] with a frown,
Lesson was learned[v], actions weighed down.

He cleaned[v] up the mess with a remorseful[a] heart,
Learned rules matter, a vital part.
Wiser he grew, mischief took flight,
In life's grand tapestry, a thread shining bright[a].
